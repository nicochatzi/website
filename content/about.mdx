Hi, I\'m Nico. My love of music technology got me into
sofware and now I just love software and cool tech.

Professionally, I\'ve worked on projects across
the tech stack. From collaborating on ISA design
for [DSP chips](https://www.analog.com/en/lp/001/beginners-guide-to-dsp.html)
at [DREAM](https://dream.fr/), to a full-stack
project with [The Collective](https://collective.focusrite.com/).
Though my primary focus is on systems software and specifically
applications that run on embedded hardware devices and CLI tooling.

There\'s something really special about making hardware
come alive through code... and then [squeezing](https://en.algorithmica.org/hpc/pipelining/branchless/)
some extra [performance](https://www.analog.com/en/resources/technical-articles/fixedpoint-vs-floatingpoint-dsp.html)
out of it. It\'s [tangible](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/RNdrQsV4bXw) and almost
[feels alive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuDw7gvd-us),
even just a [lil\'blinky](https://docs.esp-rs.org/no_std-training/03_2_blinky.html).

Since 2020, I\'ve become ["that colleague"](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/ifkrvg/i_printed_rewrite_it_in_rust_swag_for_students/)
that talks about [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
[Safety](https://www.tomshardware.com/software/security-software/white-house-urges-developers-to-avoid-c-and-c-use-memory-safe-programming-languages),
[speed](https://corrode.dev/blog/tips-for-faster-rust-compile-times/),
[tooling](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny),
[concurrency](https://blog.logrocket.com/implementing-data-parallelism-rayon-rust/)...
There\'s just so much to [love](https://www.gyata.ai/rust/rust-compiler-errors/)!

In 2021, as part of [The Collective](https://collective.focusrite.com/products/fast-verb) project, we shipped a [Rust library](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=US815F9bg5A&feature=youtu.be)
that does [DRM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management)
and [platform connection](https://aws.amazon.com/). The library integrated
into [JUCE](https://juce.com/)-based VST plugins developed by the great people @[Sonible](https://www.sonible.com/).
It\'s been in production since 2022 and deployed to thousands of customers!
I also ran dozens of Rust ["dailies"](https://www.fluentcpp.com/dailycpp/)
(15-30 min intros to specific parts of the language)
and in-house workshops at [Focusrite](https://focusrite.com/). At [ADC23](https://audio.dev/conference/),
myself and two other colleagues ran a [3h workshop](https://adc23.sched.com/event/1Pufs/workshop-using-rust-for-fast-cross-platform-development-with-your-existing-audio-libraries)
on [using Rust to in conjunction with DSP code written in C++](https://github.com/FocusriteGroup/rust-workshop-adc23).

More recently, I\'ve been [Zig](https://ziglang.org/)-curious, particularly
for squeezing the last bits of [performance out](https://alic.dev/blog/dense-enums), it\'s
[hermetic](https://www.uber.com/en-FR/blog/bootstrapping-ubers-infrastructure-on-arm64-with-zig/),
cross-platform and drop-in-GCC-replacement compiler
and not least of all its insanely cool approach to [`comptime`](https://kristoff.it/blog/what-is-zig-comptime/).
