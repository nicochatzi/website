Welcome to the world of Vim, where efficiency and keyboard wizardry reign supreme.
If you're diving into the depths of this legendary editor, you'll want to wrap your
head around three key concepts: buffers, windows, and tabs. They're the bread and
butter of any Vim power user, and getting comfortable with them is like unlocking
a new level in a game – suddenly, everything feels more fluid, more powerful, more... fun.

## Core Concepts

### Buffers: Your Editing Backbone

At its simplest, a buffer in Vim is an open file.
But it's more than that; it's an instance of your file as Vim sees it,
living in your system's memory. Whether you're tweaking a config file or
refactoring a complex codebase, every file you open is loaded into a buffer.
The cool part? You can have multiple buffers open at once, even if they're not all visible.

### Windows: Your Viewport into Vim's World

Think of windows as lenses through which you view your buffers.
A window in Vim doesn't mean a new instance of Vim; rather, it's a viewport displaying a buffer.
You can split your Vim screen into multiple windows, each showing different or even the same buffer.
It's like having multiple monitors on your desk, each showing a different perspective of your work.

### Tabs: Organizing Your Digital Workspace

Tabs in Vim aren't like the tabs in your web browser.
They're more like workspaces. Each tab can contain a different layout of windows,
allowing you to organize your work into distinct contexts. One tab could be your coding space,
another for debugging, and yet another for your project's documentation.

## Cheat Sheet

### Buffers

```text
:e filename         open file in buffer
:e!                 discard changes in current buffer
:bufdo e!           discard changes in all buffers
:ls or :buffers     list all buffers
:bn or :bnext       switch to next buffer
:bp or :bprev       switch to previous buffer
:bd or :bdelete     close current buffer
:bufdo bd           close all buffers but current
:b N                go to specific buffer N
:b name             go to specific buffer by name
:q                  close current buffer
:qa                 close all buffers
:qa!                close all buffers without saving
:wa                 save all buffers
:x                  save and exit
```

### Windows

```text
:split or ctrl-w s      split window horizontally
:vsplit or ctrl-w v     split window vertically
:close                  close current window
:new or :vnew           open buffer in new window
```

#### Default Keymaps

```text
ctrl-w h/j/k/l      move current window
ctrl-w n            create a new unpopulated window
ctrl-w s            split window horizontally
ctrl-w v            split window vertically
ctrl-w w            navigate between windows
ctrl-w c            close current window
ctrl-w o            close all other windows
ctrl-w r            rotate windows down/right
ctrl-w r            rotate windows up/left
ctrl-w =            equalize window sizes
ctrl-w +            increase window height
ctrl-w -            decrease window height
ctrl-w >            increase window width
ctrl-w <            decrease window width
```

### Tabs

```text
:tabnew or :tabe filename   open new tab
:tabn or :tabnext           switch to next tab
:tabp or :tabprev           switch to previous tab
:tabc or :tabclose          close current tab
:tabonly                    close all tabs but current
:tabn N                     move to specific tab - where N == tab number
:tabm N                     move current tab - N == new position
:tab split                  open current buffer in new tab
```

#### Default Keymaps

```text
gt      move to the next tab.
gT      move to the previous tab.
```

## Workflows

When to use it?

- Maintaining a view / layout of windows, e.g. one tab for debugging, cargo-limit triggering in a new tab...
- For specific short-lived tasks that require a different split

When not to

- <code>tmux</code> is great for window management, but it's easier to copy-paste out of the box from a single vim instance
- For project management, use <code>tmux</code> or neovim

Mastering buffers, windows, and tabs in Vim is like learning to play a musical instrument;
at first, it's a bit of a struggle, but with practice, it becomes second nature,
and you start making beautiful music – or, in our case, beautiful code.

Context Switching: Easily switch between different parts of your project. A buffer for your code, another for tests, and a window split to keep an eye on documentation? Easy peasy.
Code and Compare: Open multiple versions of a file in split windows to compare and merge changes.
Debugging Delight: Use tabs to separate different debugging contexts – one for your server logs, another for your code, and yet another for database queries.
In conclusion, Vim's buffers, windows, and tabs aren't just features; they're a mindset, a way to mold your editor to fit your workflow. They're about making your development process smoother, faster, and maybe even a little bit more enjoyable. So go ahead, embrace the Vim way of life, and watch your coding prowess soar!
